#Project starter template

Just a very, very simple boilerplate for starting projects. It's already set up with most of the dependencies I use in all my projects, including basic customizations for Git, Bower, and Grunt.

To use, do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:cphoniball/project-starter.git
$ bower install
$ npm install
```
